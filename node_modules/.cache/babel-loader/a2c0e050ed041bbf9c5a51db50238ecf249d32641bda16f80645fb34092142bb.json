However, within this turmoil, it has been said that in ancient tradition, among the elves, a child would bear the markings of the Elder Oak. But fate has an awful way of twisting one’s story. The prophecy would dictate two siblings, brother and sister. One would bring upon an era of chaos to the world, and the other a great sacrifice. </p>\r\n              <p> Andrathion, meaning son of Andrath and \"Long Journey,\" was a strong boy from birth, unlike his sister who was frail and prone to sickness. She was given the name Edlothia, meaning \"To Blossom\" or \"Flower\" in ancient tongue, in hopes she too would grow to be strong. There was nothing in this world that Andrathion cherished more than his younger sister, and it was that very love that would bring forth calamity.</p>\r\n              <img src={siblings} alt=\"siblings\"></img>\r\n              <figcaption> Andrathion and Edlothia </figcaption>\r\n              <p> The dark ages befell the lands and magic was taken from worlds, and with that came the decay. The same sickness befell Edlothia with the absence of magic. In order to save his sister from the ultimate sacrifice, Andrathion traveled the planes and stole the powers of magic, leaving behind nothing. But travelling the planes came at a cost. Remnants of such power was left behind in the worlds visited. These remnants would eventually ignite the spark within a select few, who would eventually rise to aid in the era of chaos. These individuals would be known as Planeswalkers.</p>            \r\n              <img src={burning} alt=\"Burning of Teldrassil\"></img>\r\n              <figcaption> The first of the Planeswalkers to arrive to a distraught Haven. </figcaption>\r\n              <p>Upon his return Andrathion unleashed the collective of gathered magic in an attempt to free his sister, Edlothia, from the shackles of fate. But fate has an awful way of twisting one’s story. Due to it reckless nature, the unleashed power of pure magic was unstable, bringing forth an era of void and chaos. It was then that Edlothia made her choice. She who bore the marking of the Elder Oak, blessed by the lands, returned her life force to it, planting the tiny seed of hope that would one day blossom into the realm known as Haven.</p>\r\n              <p>As the passage of time dilutes the ancient tongue, Edlothia soon became known as Eloviel.</p>\r\n              <p>Though fate may be the last page, how you earned it will undoubtedly define who you are. Though the Gods know all the moves you will ever make, even so, you did make all the moves yourself. And you, adventurer, will fate be the end of your journey?</p>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"silvenore\" id=\"silvenore\"> \r\n              <h2> Silvenore </h2>\r\n              <p> \r\n              Silvenore was once a great established city, now left shrouded in mystery and overgrowth.

Orcs and Humans live in relative peace as do drow and elves, of course the more normal races over take the realm where as the more monster or rare races simply pass on by.
