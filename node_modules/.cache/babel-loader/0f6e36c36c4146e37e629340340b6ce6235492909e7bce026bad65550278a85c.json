This server is a safe place for everyone, and we will not tolerate any misogyny, discrimination, bigotry, racism, etc.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 3. No NSFW</h2>\r\n            <p>This server does not tolerate adult themes or sexually explicit content. If any such themes occur during a quest, in a channel, or anywhere else on this server, the players involved will be severely punished. Additionally, all Player Characters must be of adult age as per the race. Items or other magic that turn player characters into children or below the age of adulthood for the race will not function.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2>4. Respect Staff</h2>\r\n            <p> In the case of disputes or server-wide issues, respect Staff decisions. We all do our best to make this server a positive and enjoyable experience for all. If you believe a Staff Member's decision to be unfair, be aware that during quests, the rules are up to the DM, the base guidelines of D&D are only guidelines. In the event that your issue is with a Senior Staff Member, another party will be taking charge.</p>\r\n            <p> If you have any concerns related to a GM's Game running style or behaviors, please feel free to utilize the <span>Unknown</span> or the <span>quest-feedback</span> channel. Additionally, this server should always be a safe space for everyone. If you are angry at a ruling or frustrated with something, feel free to take a break or open a ticket in <span>#open-a-ticket</span>, where a member of the staff team will be with you as soon as possible. We are all here for you as the Player and endeavor to make the server a safe, enjoyable environment for everyone.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 4. Blocking staff members that are moderators or above is not allowed.</h2>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 5. Don't advertise another server without permission.</h2>\r\n            <p> Partnerships are welcome, however, do not advertise without going through the proper channels. If you wish to discuss a partnership, contact a Senior Staff Member.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 6. Read Before Asking </h2>\r\n            <p> If you ever have any questions about the rules of our server, please take a look at the relevant channel first. However, if the information is not available, a Staff Member will be happy to help you.</p>\r\n            <p> Listed below are some helpful channels for reference:\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li>Any Recent Announcements - <span>announcements</span></li>\r\n                    <li>Any recent Changes throughout the server - <span>change-log</span></li>\r\n                    <li>Specific questions about D&D rules or server mechanics - <span>faq</span> and <span>sage-faq</span></li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 7. Do not abuse having multiple characters</h2>\r\n            <p> Your characters cannot interact any more than friendly conversations, brief Roleplay, and in reference. They are never allowed to trade, be in the same guild, go on the same quests, give each other items, or give each other any form of mechanical benefit.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 8. Plagiarism</h2>\r\n            <p> Do not plagiarize other people's content. This includes source books for DND and character art. If you post another artist's art, you must credit the artist, including character art. Piracy and plagiarism are absolutely not allowed on Haven. We ask that any artwork used be credited to the original owner. This includes copyright infringement.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 9. Foul Play</h2>\r\n            <p> Staff reserve the right to suspend any and all characters from play if a player is caught or suspected of cheating. This suspension lasts until staff can confirm no foul play has been committed.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 10. Age-Appropriate Behavior</h2>\r\n            <p> This server is 13+. Though most of our members are above that age, we still occasionally have children under the age of 16 reading our threads and active in our sessions. Please keep this in mind whenever you are in VC or posting something to be read. Additionally, though friendships can be formed between all players, we highly discourage the adult members of our server from communicating outside (private messaging, one-on-one VC) with underage members of the server for their own safety as well as the safety of any minors. This extends to any romantic roleplay as well. There is a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate material and predatory behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n            <h2> 11. Reporting </h2>\r\n            <p> If you see or experience anyone breaking the rules as above, please ping the <span>@Mediator</span> role as soon as you see it so that we can intervene. Staff is not always looking at every channel all the time, so the active involvement of you, the player base, is needed in order to keep the server a safe place for everyone.</p>\r\n            <p> If you have a specific complaint or concern, feel free to:\r\n                <ul>\r\n                    <li><span>open-a-ticket</span>: This channel is to speak with staff for any reason more privately, whether it's concerns over server mechanics, more complex suggestions, or anything else you don't necessarily wish to be discussed publicly. This channel is open to all moderation and senior staff teams.</li>\r\n                </ul>\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <h3>Member Infractions</h3>\r\n            <p>You can be given one of two different types of infractions: a warning or a strike.</p>\r\n            <p>Warnings: These are for minor infractions, such as inappropriate language in general, inappropriate profile pictures, general rudeness towards other players, or disrespecting staff members' decisions. A warning expires after three months. If you gather three warnings within three months, then it will equal one strike.</p>\r\n            <p>Strikes: These are for major infractions, such as the use of slurs, cheating on character sheets, demonstrated harassment of other players, or sexual misconduct. Three strikes will equal a ban from the server entirely. Furthermore, each strike will come with certain consequences. </p>\r\n            <h1>Strike Policy</h1>\r\n\r\n            <p><strong>1st Strike</strong></p>\r\n            <p>You are given a warning regarding the relevant behavior, and the infraction is documented.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p><strong>2nd Strike</strong></p>\r\n            <p>You forfeit any Gold, Items, and Loot Rolls granted from quests. Additionally, even if you do gain Exp, you do not gain ranks. You are capped for the maximum Exp for that rank. All your characters are suspended from trading and may be suspended entirely depending on the severity of the infraction. If it is a staff member, they will have all roles removed.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p><strong>3rd Strike</strong></p>\r\n            <p>You will be removed from the server.</p>\r\n\r\n            <p>An equal version has been put in place for staff as well, including the highest ranks.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <img></img>\r\n    </div>\r\n \r\n        \r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default
