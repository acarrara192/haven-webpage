Orcs and Humans live in relative peace as do drow and elves, of course the more normal races over take the realm where as the more monster or rare races simply pass on by. Nonetheless they all share prosperity and relative kinship to one another. Bad blood exists of course but to a degree of only words and not actions. </p>\r\n                <img src={namira} alt=\"namira\"></img>\r\n                <figcaption> Artist: unknown </figcaption>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className=\"solemn section\" id=\"solemn\">\r\n                <h2> Solemn - Monuments of the Dwarves </h2>\r\n                <p> Solemn is the Lakeside Mountain District whose history and traditions live on in their people, but whose secrets are buried deep within the mountain it was built upon, remaining heavily guarded by stern unmoving lips and treacherous pathways that will swallow up the unprepared. No one knows truly where the Mountain Dwarves of Solemn came from, only that a massive structure had wrapped itself around the land's elevated portion; it operates under a stratocratic government, with mandatory military service being among its most ancient traditions, shaping their dark disposition and neigh endless war against forces unseen by Haven. </p>\r\n                <img src={solemn} alt=\"solemn\"></img>\r\n              </div>\r\n              <div className=\"shambhala section\" id=\"shambhala\">\r\n                <h2> Shambhala - Lost City of the Elves </h2>\r\n                <p> Shambhala, the lost kingdom of the Elves. Named after its sovereign Xiān'bālā Zhèn. A once immortal city, vast in culture and tradition of the High Elves. Created though and from Arselu'Tel'Quess, which loosely translates to \"Great Art of the People\" otherwise known as High Elven Magic. Shambhala will only reveal itself to those it deems worthy of its splendor. Most will never see these lands in their lifetime, only a select few will ever witness its majesty. The Everheart calls to those who possess the inner potential, those who have faced the trials before them and have proven themselves masters of their own kind. </p>\r\n                <img src={shambhala} alt=\"shambhala\"></img>\r\n              </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n  export default Lore;\r\n  \r\n\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,YAAY;AACnB,OAAOC,QAAQ,MAAM,0CAA0C;AAC/D,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,4CAA4C;AAChE,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,4BAA4B;AAClD,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAC5C,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAC5C,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,4BAA4B;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAGlD,SAASC,IAAIA,CAAA,EAAG;EACZ,oBACMD,OAAA;IAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;IAAAC,QAAA,eAC3BH,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAAAC,QAAA,gBAC/BH,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC;MAAuB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eAE3CP,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAAoB;QAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7BP,OAAA;QAAAI,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAQ,CAAC,eACTP,OAAA;QAAKQ,EAAE,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAACN,SAAS,EAAC,wBAAwB;QAAAC,QAAA,gBACzDH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAQH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;QAAkB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAY,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACxC,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKQ,EAAE,EAAC,cAAc;QAACN,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAsB;QAAAC,QAAA,gBACrDH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAc;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvBP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAmd;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC1dP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA6Z;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACpaP,OAAA;UAAKS,GAAG,EAAEhB,QAAS;UAACiB,GAAG,EAAC;QAAU;UAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACzCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;QAAyB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAClDP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAikB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACxkBP,OAAA;UAAKS,GAAG,EAAEf,OAAQ;UAACgB,GAAG,EAAC;QAAuB;UAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACrDP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;QAAiE;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAC1FP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAuhB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9hBP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAyF;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAChGP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAwP;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC5P,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;QAACM,EAAE,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,gBAC/CH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAW;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpBP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAMH;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJP,OAAA;UAAKS,GAAG,EAAEd,SAAU;UAACe,GAAG,EAAC;QAAW;UAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eAC3CP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;QAAwB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAY,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC9C,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAACM,EAAE,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAAL,QAAA,gBACzCH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAoC;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7CP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAg1B;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACv1BP,OAAA;UAAKS,GAAG,EAAEb,MAAO;UAACc,GAAG,EAAC;QAAQ;UAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACrCP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;QAAiB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAY,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACvC,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,gBAAgB;QAACM,EAAE,EAAC,QAAQ;QAAAL,QAAA,gBACzCH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAmC;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5CP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAA2nB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACloBP,OAAA;UAAKS,GAAG,EAAEZ,MAAO;UAACa,GAAG,EAAC;QAAQ;UAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAM,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAClC,CAAC,eACNP,OAAA;QAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,mBAAmB;QAACM,EAAE,EAAC,WAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,gBAC/CH,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;QAAoC;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7CP,OAAA;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;QAAinB;UAAAC,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACxnBP,OAAA;UAAKS,GAAG,EAAEX,SAAU;UAACY,GAAG,EAAC;QAAW;UAAAN,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAM,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OACxC,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACH;EAAC;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEd;AAACI,EAAA,GAhEMV,IAAI;AAiEX,eAAeA,IAAI;AAAC,IAAAU,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
