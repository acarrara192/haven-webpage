The old realm of Namira is lost to time and the old minds of its founders, all that is known about their past life was darkness and dreary days. Eloviel founded this world and saw its potential for a new beginning, knowing it even deserved much of it. Namira has then since thrived, thrusting forward and is now the center of the realm known as Haven . A commoners area of mostly well, every race. Orcs and Humans live in relative peace as do drow and elves, of course the more normal races over take the realm where as the more monster or rare races simply pass on by. Nonetheless they all share prosperity and relative kinship to one another. Bad blood exists of course but to a degree of only words and not actions. </p>\r\n              <img src={namira} alt=\"namira\"></img>\r\n              <figcaption> Artist: unknown </figcaption>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"solemn\" id=\"solemn\">\r\n              <h2> Solemn - Monuments of the Dwarves </h2>\r\n              <p> Solemn is the Lakeside Mountain District whose history and traditions live on in their people, but whose secrets are buried deep within the mountain it was built upon, remaining heavily guarded by stern unmoving lips and treacherous pathways that will swallow up the unprepared. No one knows truly where the Mountain Dwarves of Solemn came from, only that a massive structure had wrapped itself around the land's elevated portion; it operates under a stratocratic government, with mandatory military service being among its most ancient traditions, shaping their dark disposition and neigh endless war against forces unseen by Haven. </p>\r\n              <img src={solemn} alt=\"solemn\"></img>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div className=\"shambhala\" id=\"shambhala\">\r\n              <h2> Shambhala - Lost City of the Elves </h2>\r\n              <p> Shambhala, the lost kingdom of the Elves.
