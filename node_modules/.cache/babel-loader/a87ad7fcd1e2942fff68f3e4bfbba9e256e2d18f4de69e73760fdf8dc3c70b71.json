Created though and from Arselu'Tel'Quess, which loosely translates to \"Great Art of the People\" otherwise known as High Elven Magic. Shambhala will only reveal itself to those it deems worthy of its splendor. Most will never see these lands in their lifetime, only a select few will ever witness its majesty. The Everheart calls to those who possess the inner potential, those who have faced the trials before them and have proven themselves masters of their own kind. </p>\r\n              <img src={shambhala} alt=\"shambhala\"></img>\r\n            </div>\r\n          </div>\r\n    );\r\n  }\r\n  export default Lore;\r\n  \r\n\r\n"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,KAAK,MAAM,OAAO;AACzB,OAAO,YAAY;AACnB,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,+BAA+B;AAClD,OAAOC,QAAQ,MAAM,0CAA0C;AAC/D,OAAOC,OAAO,MAAM,4CAA4C;AAChE,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,4BAA4B;AAClD,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAC5C,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,yBAAyB;AAC5C,OAAOC,SAAS,MAAM,4BAA4B;AAAA,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAGlD,SAASC,IAAIA,CAAA,EAAG;EACZ,oBACMD,OAAA;IAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,cAAc;IAAAC,QAAA,gBAC3BH,OAAA;MAAKI,EAAE,EAAC,gBAAgB;MAACF,SAAS,EAAC,wBAAwB;MAAAC,QAAA,gBACzDH,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAAoB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7BR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAQH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;QAAKS,GAAG,EAAEjB,MAAO;QAACkB,GAAG,EAAC;MAAQ;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACrCR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;MAAkB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACxC,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;MAAKI,EAAE,EAAC,cAAc;MAACF,SAAS,EAAC,sBAAsB;MAAAC,QAAA,gBACrDH,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAAc;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACvBR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAAmd;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC1dR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAA6Z;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACpaR,OAAA;QAAKS,GAAG,EAAEhB,QAAS;QAACiB,GAAG,EAAC;MAAU;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACzCR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;MAAyB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAClDR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAAikB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACxkBR,OAAA;QAAKS,GAAG,EAAEf,OAAQ;QAACgB,GAAG,EAAC;MAAuB;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACrDR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;MAAiE;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC,eAC1FR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAAuhB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAC9hBR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAAyF;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAChGR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAAwP;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAC5P,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;MAACE,EAAE,EAAC,WAAW;MAAAD,QAAA,gBACvCH,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAAW;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACpBR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAMH;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJR,OAAA;QAAKS,GAAG,EAAEd,SAAU;QAACe,GAAG,EAAC;MAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eAC3CR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;MAAwB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAC9C,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;MAACE,EAAE,EAAC,QAAQ;MAAAD,QAAA,gBACjCH,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAAoC;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7CR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAAg1B;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACv1BR,OAAA;QAAKS,GAAG,EAAEb,MAAO;QAACc,GAAG,EAAC;MAAQ;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAM,CAAC,eACrCR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAY;MAAiB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAY,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACvC,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,QAAQ;MAACE,EAAE,EAAC,QAAQ;MAAAD,QAAA,gBACjCH,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAAmC;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC5CR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAA2nB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACloBR,OAAA;QAAKS,GAAG,EAAEZ,MAAO;QAACa,GAAG,EAAC;MAAQ;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAM,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAClC,CAAC,eACNR,OAAA;MAAKE,SAAS,EAAC,WAAW;MAACE,EAAE,EAAC,WAAW;MAAAD,QAAA,gBACvCH,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAI;MAAoC;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eAC7CR,OAAA;QAAAG,QAAA,EAAG;MAAinB;QAAAE,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACxnBR,OAAA;QAAKS,GAAG,EAAEX,SAAU;QAACY,GAAG,EAAC;MAAW;QAAAL,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAM,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACxC,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEd;AAACG,EAAA,GA5DMV,IAAI;AA6DX,eAAeA,IAAI;AAAC,IAAAU,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA"},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
