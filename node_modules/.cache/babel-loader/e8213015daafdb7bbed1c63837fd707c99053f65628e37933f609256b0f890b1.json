We ask that any artwork used be credited to the original owner. This includes copyright infringement.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2> 9. Foul Play</h2>\r\n        <p> Staff reserve the right to suspend any and all characters from play if a player is caught or suspected of cheating. This suspension lasts until staff can confirm no foul play has been committed.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2> 10. Age-Appropriate Behavior</h2>\r\n        <p> This server is 13+. Though most of our members are above that age, we still occasionally have children under the age of 16 reading our threads and active in our sessions. Please keep this in mind whenever you are in VC or posting something to be read. Additionally, though friendships can be formed between all players, we highly discourage the adult members of our server from communicating outside (private messaging, one-on-one VC) with underage members of the server for their own safety as well as the safety of any minors. This extends to any romantic roleplay as well. There is a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate material and predatory behavior.</p>\r\n\r\n        <h2> 11. Reporting </h2>\r\n        <p> If you see or experience anyone breaking the rules as above, please ping the <span>@Mediator</span> role as soon as you see it so that we can intervene. Staff is not always looking at every channel all the time, so the active involvement of you, the player base, is needed in order to keep the server a safe place for everyone.</p>\r\n        <p> If you have a specific complaint or concern, feel free to:\r\n            <ul>\r\n                <li><span>open-a-ticket</span>: This channel is to speak with staff for any reason more privately, whether it's concerns over server mechanics, more complex suggestions, or anything else you don't necessarily wish to be discussed publicly. This channel is open to all moderation and senior staff teams.</li>\r\n            </ul>\r\n        </p>\r\n\r\n        <h3>Member Infractions</h3>\r\n        <p>You can be given one of two different types of infractions: a warning or a strike.</p>\r\n        <p>Warnings: These are for minor infractions, such as inappropriate language in general, inappropriate profile pictures, general rudeness towards other players, or disrespecting staff members' decisions. A warning expires after three months. If you gather three warnings within three months, then it will equal one strike.</p>\r\n        <p>Strikes: These are for major infractions, such as the use of slurs, cheating on character sheets, demonstrated harassment of other players, or sexual misconduct. Three strikes will equal a ban from the server entirely. Furthermore, each strike will come with certain consequences. </p>\r\n        <h1>Strike Policy</h1>\r\n\r\n        <p><strong>1st Strike</strong></p>\r\n        <p>You are given a warning regarding the relevant behavior, and the infraction is documented.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p><strong>2nd Strike</strong></p>\r\n        <p>You forfeit any Gold, Items, and Loot Rolls granted from quests. Additionally, even if you do gain Exp, you do not gain ranks. You are capped for the maximum Exp for that rank. All your characters are suspended from trading and may be suspended entirely depending on the severity of the infraction. If it is a staff member, they will have all roles removed.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p><strong>3rd Strike</strong></p>\r\n        <p>You will be removed from the server.</p>\r\n\r\n        <p>An equal version has been put in place for staff as well, including the highest ranks.</p>\r\n    </div>\r\n \r\n        \r\n    )\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Rules
